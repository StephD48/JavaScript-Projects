# JavaScript-Projects
These are some small projects I made using JavaScript.

**Project:**
-Pizza Menu
-Tic-Tac-Toe Game
-Calculator

**Pizza Menu:**
This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. It then takes the input
information and calculates a price for the order.

**Tic-Tac-Toe Game:**
The classic game of tic-tac-toe. Each player is either the X or O. When each user takes their turn there is a sound 
indicating the move and the next player is ready to make their move. When a winner is determined they are celebrated with music
and the game resets for another round.

**Calculator:**
A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply and divide on s sleek web version of a calculator.
